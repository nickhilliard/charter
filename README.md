### Rechartering September 2025:
- **File:** [sidrops-charter-02.md](sidrops-charter-02.md)
- **Objectives:** Small update to allow the group to publish Standard Track documents. This was pointed out by the [IESG during the review](https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/sidrops/O0eh-6pOTP0-NCEPmj5woz9m7o0/) of [draft-ietf-sidrops-manifest-numbers](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-sidrops-manifest-numbers/), whose RFC intended is Standard Track, but the charter (-01, approved on 2016-11-07) only includes informational and BCP documents as output of the WG. The proposed small update of the charter that includes PS documents as output of the WG. It allows as well to update the milestones and explicitly include ASPA and YANG model works in the charter.
